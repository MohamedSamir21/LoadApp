# LoadApp <br>
This app downloads a file from the Internet by clicking on a custom-built button where:
<ul>
  <li>width of the button gets animated from left to right</li>
  <li>text gets changed based on different states of the button</li>
  <li>circle gets animated from 0 to 360 degrees</li>
</ul>
A notification will be sent once the download is complete. When a user clicks on the notification, the user lands on detail activity and the notification gets dismissed. 
In the detail activity, the status of the download will be displayed and animated via MotionLayout upon opening the activity.
